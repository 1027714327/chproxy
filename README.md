# chproxy [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy)

Chproxy, is an http proxy for [ClickHouse](https://ClickHouse.yandex) database. It provides the following features:

- May proxy requests to multiple distinct `ClickHouse` clusters depending on the input user. For instance, requests from `appserver` user may go to `stats-raw` cluster, while requests from `reportserver` user may go to `stats-aggregate` cluster.
- May map input users to per-cluster users. This prevents from exposing real usernames and passwords used in `ClickHouse` clusters.
- May accept incoming requests via HTTP and HTTPS.
- May limit HTTP and HTTPS access by IP/IP-mask lists.
- May limit per-user access by IP/IP-mask lists.
- May limit per-user query duration. Timed out queries are forcibly killed via [KILL QUERY](http://clickhouse-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/query_language/queries.html#kill-query).
- May limit per-user requests rate.
- May limit per-user number of concurrent requests.
- All the limits may be independently set for each input user and for each per-cluster user.
- Evenly spreads requests among cluster nodes using `least loaded` + `round robin` technique.
- Monitors node health and prevents from sending requests to unhealthy nodes.
- Supports automatic HTTPS certificate issuing and renewal via [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
- May proxy requests to each configured cluster via either HTTP or HTTPS.
- Prepends User-Agent request header with remote/local address and input username before proxying it to `ClickHouse`, so this info may be queried from [system.query_log.http_user_agent](https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/issues/847).
- Exposes various useful [metrics](#metrics) in [prometheus text format](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/).
- Configuration may be updated without restart - just send `SIGHUP` signal to `chproxy` process.
- Easy to manage and run - just pass config file path to a single `chproxy` binary.
- Easy to [configure](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config/examples/simple.yml):
```yml
server:
  http:
      listen_addr: ":9090"
      allowed_networks: ["127.0.0.0/24"]

users:
  - name: "default"
    to_cluster: "default"
    to_user: "default"

# by default each cluster has `default` user which can be overridden by section `users`
clusters:
  - name: "default"
    nodes: ["127.0.0.1:8123"]

```

## Why it was created

`ClickHouse` may exceed [max_execution_time](http://clickhouse-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings/query_complexity.html#max-execution-time) and [max_concurrent_queries](https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/blob/add13f233eb6d30da4c75c4309542047a1dde033/dbms/src/Server/config.xml#L75) limits due to various reasons:
- `max_execution_time` may be exceeded due to the current [implementation deficiencies](https://github.com/yandex/ClickHouse/issues/217).
- `max_concurrent_queries` works only on a per-node basis. There is no way to limit the number of concurrent queries on a cluster if queries are spread across cluster nodes.

Such "leaky" limits may lead to high resource usage on all the cluster nodes. We had to launch a dedicated http proxy for sending all the requests to a dedicated `ClickHouse` node under the given user. So we had to maintain two distinct http proxies in front of our `ClickHouse` cluster - one for spreading `INSERTs` among cluster nodes and another one for sending `SELECTs` to a dedicated node where limits may be enforced somehow. This was fragile and inconvenient to manage, so `chproxy` has been created :)


## Use cases

### Spread `INSERTs` among cluster shards

Usually `INSERTs` are sent from application servers located in a limited number of subnetworks. `INSERTs` from other subnetworks must be denied.

All the `INSERTs` may be routed to a distributed table on a single node. But this increases resource usage (CPU and network) on the node comparing to other nodes, since it must parse each row to be inserted and route it to the corresponding node (shard).

It would be better to spread `INSERTs` among available shards and to route them directly to per-shard tables instead of distributed tables. The routing logic may be embedded either directly into applications generating `INSERTs` or may be moved to a proxy. Proxy approach is better since it allows re-configuring `ClickHouse` cluster without modification of application configs and without application downtime. Multiple identical proxies may be started on distinct servers for scalability and availability purposes.

The following minimal `chproxy` config may be used for this [use case](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config/examples/spread.inserts.yml):
```yml
server:
  http:
      listen_addr: ":9090"

      # Networks with application servers.
      allowed_networks: ["10.10.1.0/24"]

users:
  - name: "insert"
    to_cluster: "stats-raw"
    to_user: "default"

clusters:
  - name: "stats-raw"

    # Requests are spread in `round-robin` + `least-loaded` fashion among nodes.
    # Unreachable and unhealthy nodes are skipped.
    nodes: [
      "10.10.10.1:8123",
      "10.10.10.2:8123",
      "10.10.10.3:8123",
      "10.10.10.4:8123"
    ]
```

### Spread `SELECTs` from reporting apps among cluster nodes

Reporting servers are usually located in a limited number of subnetworks. Reporting apps usually generate various customer reports from `SELECT` query results. The load generated by such `SELECTs` on `ClickHouse` cluster may vary depending on the number of online customers and on the generated reports. It is obvious that the load must be limited in order to prevent cluster overload.

All the `SELECTs` may be routed to a distributed table on a single node. But this increases resource usage (RAM, CPU and network) on the node comparing to other nodes, since it must do final aggregation, sorting and filtering for the data obtained from cluster nodes (shards).

It would be better to create identical distributed table on each shard and spread `SELECTs` among all the available shards.

The following minimal `chproxy` config may be used for this [use case](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config/examples/spread.selects.yml):
```yml
server:
  http:
      listen_addr: ":9090"

      # Networks with reporting servers.
      allowed_networks: ["10.10.2.0/24"]

users:
  - name: "report"
    to_cluster: "stats-aggregate"
    to_user: "readonly"
    max_concurrent_queries: 6
    max_execution_time: 1m

clusters:
  - name: "stats-aggregate"
    nodes: [
      "10.10.20.1:8123",
      "10.10.20.2:8123"
    ]
    users:
      - name: "readonly"
        password: "****"
```

### Authorize users by passwords via HTTPS

Suppose you need to access `ClickHouse` cluster from anywhere by username/password.
This may be used for building graphs from [ClickHouse-grafana](https://github.com/Vertamedia/ClickHouse-grafana) or [tabix](https://tabix.io/).
It is bad idea to transfer unencrypted password and data over untrusted networks.
So HTTPS must be used for accessing the cluster in such cases.
The following `chproxy` config may be used for this [use case](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config/examples/https.yml):
```yml
server:
  https:
    listen_addr: ":443"
    autocert:
      cache_dir: "certs_dir"

users:
  - name: "web"
    password: "****"
    to_cluster: "stats-raw"
    to_user: "web"
    max_concurrent_queries: 4
    max_execution_time: 30s
    requests_per_minute: 10
    deny_http: true

clusters:
  - name: "stats-raw"
    nodes: [
     "10.10.10.1:8123",
     "10.10.10.2:8123",
     "10.10.10.3:8123",
     "10.10.10.4:8123"
    ]
    users:
      - name: "web"
        password: "****"
```

### All the above configs combined

All the above cases may be combined in a single `chproxy` [config](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config/examples/combined.yml):

```yml
server:
  http:
      listen_addr: ":9090"
      allowed_networks: ["10.10.1.0/24","10.10.2.0/24"]
  https:
    listen_addr: ":443"
    autocert:
      cache_dir: "certs_dir"

users:
  - name: "insert"
    allowed_networks: ["10.10.1.0/24"]
    to_cluster: "stats-raw"
    to_user: "default"

  - name: "report"
    allowed_networks: ["10.10.2.0/24"]
    to_cluster: "stats-aggregate"
    to_user: "readonly"
    max_concurrent_queries: 6
    max_execution_time: 1m

  - name: "web"
    password: "****"
    to_cluster: "stats-raw"
    to_user: "web"
    max_concurrent_queries: 4
    max_execution_time: 30s
    requests_per_minute: 10
    deny_http: true

clusters:
  - name: "stats-aggregate"
    nodes: [
      "10.10.20.1:8123",
      "10.10.20.2:8123"
    ]
    users:
    - name: "readonly"
      password: "****"

  - name: "stats-raw"
    nodes: [
     "10.10.10.1:8123",
     "10.10.10.2:8123",
     "10.10.10.3:8123",
     "10.10.10.4:8123"
    ]
    users:
      - name: "default"

      - name: "web"
        password: "****"
```

## Configuration

### Server
`Chproxy` may accept requests over `HTTP` and `HTTPS` protocols. [HTTPS](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#https_config) must be configured with custom certificate or with automated [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates.

Access to `chproxy` can be limitied by list of IPs or IP masks. This option can be applied to [HTTP](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#http_config), [HTTPS](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#https_config), [metrics](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#metrics_config), [user](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#user_config) or [cluster-user](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#cluster_user_config).

### Users
There are two types of users: `in-users` (in global section) and `out-users` (in cluster section).
This means all requests will be matched to `in-users` and if all checks are Ok - will be matched to `out-users`
with overriding credentials.

Suppose we have one ClickHouse user `web` with `read-only` permissions and `max_concurrent_queries=4` limit.
There are two distinct applications `reading` from ClickHouse. We may create two distinct `in-users` with `to_user=web` and `nmax_concurrent_queries=2` each in order to avoid situation when a single application exhausts all the 4-request limit on the `web` user.

Requests to `chproxy` must be authorized with credentials from [user_config](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#user_config). Credentials can be passed via BasicAuth or via URL `user` and `password` params.

Limits for `in-users` and `out-users` are independent.

### Clusters
`Chproxy` can be configured with multiple `cluster`s. Each `cluster` must have a name and a list of nodes.
Requests to each cluster are balanced using `round-robin` + `least-loaded` approach.
The node priority is automatically decreased for a short interval if recent requests to it were unsuccessful.
This means that the `chproxy` will choose the next least loaded healthy node for every new request.

Additionally each node is periodically checked for availability. Unavailable nodes are automatically excluded from the cluster until they become available again. This allows performing node maintenance without removing temporarily unavailable nodes from the cluster config.

`Chproxy` automatically kills queris exceeding `max_execution_time` limit. By default `chproxy` tries to kill such queries
under `default` user. The user may be overriden with [kill_query_user](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#kill_query_user_config).


If `cluster`'s [users](https://github.com/Vertamedia/chproxy/blob/master/config#cluster_user_config) section isn't specified, then `default` user is used with no limits.

### Security
`Chproxy` removes all the query params from input requests (except the `query`) before proxying them to `ClickHouse` nodes. This prevents from unsafe overriding of various `ClickHouse` [settings](http://clickhouse-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interfaces/http_interface.html).

Be careful when configuring limits, allowed networks, passwords etc.
By default `chproxy` tries detecting the most obvious configuration errors such as `allowed_networks: ["0.0.0.0/0"]` or sending passwords via unencrypted HTTP. Use `hack_me_please=true` for disabling all the security-related checks when applying new config.

## FAQ

* *Is `chproxy` production ready?*

  Yes, we successfully use it in production for both `INSERT` and `SELECT`
  requests.

* *What about `chproxy` performance?*

  A single `chproxy` instance easily proxies 1Gbps of compressed `INSERT` data
  while using less than 20% of a single CPU core in our production setup.

* *Does `chproxy` support [native interface](http://clickhouse-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interfaces/tcp.html) for ClickHouse?*

  No. Because currently all our services work with ClickHouse only via HTTP.
  Support for `native interface` may be added in the future.
